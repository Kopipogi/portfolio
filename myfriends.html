        <h2>Jon Eric Manangan</h2>
        <p>My friend Jon Eric Manangan and I first crossed paths through a serendipitous encounter surrounding a santol tree in our backyard. It was a warm day, and Jon Eric was picking santol fruits from the tree at our house. Little did I know that this seemingly ordinary event would lay the foundation for a lasting friendship. As we shared laughter amidst the rustling leaves and the sweet fragrance of the santol, a camaraderie was born. Our initial connection over the simple act of harvesting fruit soon evolved into a deeper bond. Over time, our friendship expanded beyond the confines of our backyard, finding a common ground on the basketball court. Playing basketball together became a cherished pastime, solidifying the memories of our shared roots and the unique way our friendship blossomed from the branches of that santol tree..</p>

        <h2>Tristan Carlo Jolampong</h2>
        <p>Tristan Carlo Jolampong entered my life on the vibrant stage of a basketball court, where our connection sprouted from a shared passion for the game. Our initial meeting as teammates sparked a camaraderie that transcended the court boundaries. The thrill of competition and the joy of victory or defeat became the backdrop to the early chapters of our friendship. Day after day, the basketball court transformed into a sacred space where the bonds of our friendship deepened. As the echoes of dribbles and cheers filled the air, so did the foundation of a lasting companionship. Fast forward to the present, and Tristan and I have not only preserved our basketball camaraderie but have also taken an unexpected turn in our journey together. Fate led us to the same professional path, both finding ourselves as Foodpanda riders in the same company. Beyond the court, we now navigate the bustling streets, delivering meals to hungry patrons, and our shared experiences on and off the court continue to weave the fabric of our enduring friendship.</p>
